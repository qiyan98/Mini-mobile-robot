# Mini-mobile-robot
Autonomous following mini-robot, course project for Design and Manufacturing II, 2017 autumn semester.
This is the C code for 51 MCU that controls the robot. Designed and built a differential-driven autonomous user-following mini-robot from scratch, which adopted ultrasonic localization sensors to detect userâ€™s bearing and distance and infrared sensors for obstacle avoidance.
